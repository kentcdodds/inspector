# Tool Cancellation Feature Tests

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite added for the tool cancellation feature.

## Test Files Added/Modified

### 1. `src/components/__tests__/ToolsTab.test.tsx` (Modified)
Added a new "Tool Cancellation" test suite with 6 tests covering UI behavior:

- **`should not show cancel button when tool is not running`** - Verifies cancel button is hidden when no tool is executing
- **`should show cancel button when tool is running`** - Verifies cancel button appears when a tool is executing
- **`should call cancelTool when cancel button is clicked`** - Tests that clicking the cancel button triggers the cancelTool function
- **`should disable run button when tool is running`** - Ensures the run button is disabled and shows "Running..." text during execution
- **`should show both run and cancel buttons with proper layout when running`** - Tests the flex layout and styling of buttons during execution
- **`should not call cancelTool when no tool is running`** - Ensures cancelTool is not called when no cancel button is present

Also updated the existing test:
- **`should disable button and change text while tool is running`** - Modified to work with the new props-based state management

### 2. `src/__tests__/toolCancellation.unit.test.tsx` (New)
Created comprehensive unit tests for the core cancellation logic with 11 tests across 5 categories:

#### Concurrent Call Prevention (2 tests)
- **`should prevent concurrent tool calls`** - Tests that rapid clicks don't create multiple concurrent tool executions
- **`should allow new calls after previous call completes`** - Ensures new calls can be made after completion

#### AbortError Detection (2 tests)
- **`should properly detect AbortError and set cancellation message`** - Tests proper detection of AbortError vs other errors
- **`should treat regular errors as failures, not cancellations`** - Ensures network errors aren't treated as cancellations

#### Race Condition Protection (2 tests)
- **`should not update state if abort controller has changed`** - Tests protection against stale state updates
- **`should not clear abort controller if it has changed`** - Tests protection against premature controller clearing

#### Cancellation Function (2 tests)
- **`should abort the current controller when cancelTool is called`** - Tests the cancelTool function behavior
- **`should do nothing when no tool is running`** - Tests cancelTool safety when no tool is active

#### State Management (3 tests)
- **`should properly manage abort controller lifecycle`** - Tests complete lifecycle management
- **`should clear abort controller even on errors`** - Tests cleanup on error conditions
- **`should clear abort controller even on cancellation`** - Tests cleanup on cancellation

## Test Coverage

### UI Component Tests (ToolsTab)
✅ Cancel button visibility based on tool running state  
✅ Cancel button functionality and event handling  
✅ Run button state management during execution  
✅ Proper button layout and styling  
✅ Integration with cancelTool prop function  

### Core Logic Tests (Unit Tests)
✅ Race condition prevention for concurrent calls  
✅ Proper AbortError vs regular error detection  
✅ State update protection against race conditions  
✅ Abort controller lifecycle management  
✅ Error handling and cleanup in all scenarios  
✅ Cancellation function safety and behavior  

### Key Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Happy Path**: Normal tool execution and cancellation
2. **Race Conditions**: Rapid button clicks and concurrent operations
3. **Error Handling**: Proper distinction between cancellation and failures
4. **State Consistency**: UI state matches actual execution state
5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of abort controllers
6. **Edge Cases**: Cancelling when no tool is running, multiple rapid cancellations

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Total Tests**: 36 tests (25 existing + 11 new)
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of all cancellation scenarios
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, component tests, integration scenarios
- **Code Quality**: All tests pass ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks
- **Reliability**: Tests use proper mocking and isolation techniques

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all cancellation-related tests
npm test -- --testEnvironment=jsdom --testPathPattern="(ToolsTab|toolCancellation)"

# Run just the ToolsTab component tests
npm test -- --testEnvironment=jsdom --testPathPattern="ToolsTab.test.tsx"

# Run just the unit tests
npm test -- --testEnvironment=jsdom --testPathPattern="toolCancellation.unit.test.tsx"
```

## Test Architecture

The test suite follows a layered approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test the core cancellation logic in isolation
2. **Component Tests**: Test the UI behavior and user interactions
3. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components and logic

This ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining test isolation and reliability.
